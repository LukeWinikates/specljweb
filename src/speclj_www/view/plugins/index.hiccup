[:p "With plugin support, you can customize the functionality of your testing framework. Speclj makes it easy to use existing plugins and create new plugins."]

[:p "In the sidebar, we list all of the plugins that are currently available. Instructions on how to use each plugin is on its associated page. If you built a plugin and would like it to be listed here, let us know by sending us a message " [:a {:href "http://groups.google.com/group/speclj"} "here"] "."]

[:p "If you want to build a plugin all you have to do is create a Leiningen project that includes speclj in the project.clj file and extend the project as you see fit. If you want an example, simply take a look at the source code of one of the existing plugins."]
